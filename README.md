This is my repo of duckyscripts.

A USB Rubber Ducky is a fine little device.
It pretends to be a keyboard and can do whatever a keyboard can do.
It looks like an innocent USB stick.

## Examples:
- Pranking people with a rickroll
- Quickly executing a routine task on a computer
- Opening a reverse shell
- Exfiltrating documents from a target
- Doing your homework
- I don't think it can do your homework actually
- Impress girls... yea idk about that one either
